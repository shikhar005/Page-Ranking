# Page-Ranking
PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.
To use it just enter a websites name when final.py is executed.
Using it will traverse through all the links of the entered url and will generate a excel file named connection matrix.
URL at top of the connection matrix is known as authority page i.e. page with highest count of inlinks and outlinks.
